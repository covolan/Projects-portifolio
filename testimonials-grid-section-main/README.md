## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS

### What I learned

As aways I started making the markdown part of the document, trying to be as semmantical as possible.

Then, came the scss part, pretty straight foward, a lot of nth:child() used and the media query was pretty small. A very fun project overall. Pretty good to get used to grid display properties.
