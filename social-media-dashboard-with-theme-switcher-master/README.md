## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS for style
- Vanilla JS for the scripts
- Mobile first approach

### What I learned

This challenge was a new experience for me, as I never before did a mobile first app. Was quite fun, I learned a lot doint it so. A lot of little challenges trough out the process of building the app. I ended up using the add and remove class approach in the script part. Also I used a open source script to add a hover animation in each of the displayed cards. Overall a unique experience, I will eventually go back to the mobile first approach when I see it fits. Thanks for [@muhammad-medhat](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/muhammad-medhat) pointed it out the mobile first approach in a past challenge!
